C++ Exercise: Calculator
1. Write a program that will receive user input in the form
	<number> <math operator> <number>
	and will print the result of the mathematical expression.
2. Valid input: Any number, four basic math operations.
3. Keep in mind, that this program is intended for casual users, and so
	should not assume they know what “*” means (but maybe they do!)
4. Input examples:
